            <h1>Scott Wiley</h1>
            <p>I am a creative and logical web developer who can pull from my past experiences as a buyer at Abercrombie and Fitch to meet the needs of an ever changing industry. I’m passionate about finding a fast paced environment at the cross roads of fashion and function with a little bit of fun in between. Putting my development skills with a personable demeanor will hopefully bring some spice to the team. And I’m 6’9 if you were wondering.
