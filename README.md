**Approach Taken:**

I started this out with grand ideas. I wrote them all down and decided what is the most basic version of this game that I can take. I broke it into steps if I wanted to make this program better each time:
- [x] 1 player, clickable, clients displayed in order
- [x] 1 player, draggable, clients displayed in order
- [ ] 2 player, draggable, clients displayed in order
- [ ] 2 player, draggable, clients at random

**Unsolved Problems:**

- I couldn't get two players to work in a logical sense to play into this game

- I couldn't figure out how to scroll through the array of clients randomly while pushing the already used clients to a "used" array.

- I wanted to get a special screen to pop up when the player chooses the three best options to display a picture of the entire outfit being worn and a link to the outfit. Also this was going to be worth a special amount of points.

- I also wanted to use a special font for each client to express the different personality of each client.
